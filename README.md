Tutorial for first-principles calculation of electronic band structure


## Resources 
Here is a list of resources on the density functional theory as well as tutorials on Quantum ESPRESSO. 

### Density functional theory 
- **A bird's-eye view of density-functional theory**: an accessible introductory article to the DFT and Khon-Sham equations. [Arxiv:0211443](https://arxiv.org/abs/cond-mat?0211443)
- **Castep workshop lectures**: the beginning few [lectures](http://cmt.dur.ac.uk/sjc/Castep_Lectures2/) provide great notes on the philosophy and the proper way to do first-principles calculations of material properties 
- **DENSITY FUNCTIONAL THEORY: A Practical Introduction**: a short and book on DFT where the first few chapters provide a very readable introduction to the DFT. 


### Quantum ESPRESSO tutorials
- **Quantum ESPRESSO [documentations](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/resources/users-manual/specific-documentation)**: the most reliable source of information on the QE but not as much accessible.   
- **Quantum ESPRESSO workshops**: a list of available lecture notes on the [QE website](https://www.quantum-espresso.org/resources/tutorials) on how to setup and run DFT calculations in Quantum ESPRESSO. 

### Online Courses and video lectures
- **Online course on Computational Materials Physics (http://compmatphys.epotentia.com)**
