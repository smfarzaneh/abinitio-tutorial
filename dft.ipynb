    "## Schrodinger's Equation\n",
    "The starting point of our discussion is the Schrodinger's equation which describes the dynamics of the electrons and nuclei in the non-relativistic limit.\n",
    "Although the complete description of a relativistic system is given by the Dirac equation, for simplicity, we discuss the density functional theory in the non-relativistic limit. \n",
    "The relativistic effects can be incorporated by modifying the kinetic term in the Schrodinger's equation or the Kohn-Sham equations introduced later.\n",
    "Since we are interested in the non-transient properties of the system, we start with the time-independent Schrodinger's equation which is usually written as an eigenvalue equation as follows  \n",

    "    \\mathcal{H}\\psi(\\mathbf{x}) = E\\psi(\\mathbf{x}), \n",
    "\\end{equation}  \n",
    "\n",
    "where $\\mathcal{H}$ is the Hamiltonian operating on the wavefunctions $\\psi(\\mathbf{x})$ and $\\mathbf{x}$ contains all degrees of freedom of the system such as the position of the nuclei $\\mathbf{R}_i$, the position of electrons $\\mathbf{r}_i$ as well as the spin angular momentum. \n",
    "Here we apply our first approximation known as Born-Oppenheimer which asserts that the dynamics of the nuclei and electrons can be treated separately. \n",
    "Since the nuclei are much heavier than the electrons the characteristics time scale of electron dynamics is much shorter than that of nuclei and therefore the nuclei are seen by electrons as a fixed potential.\n",
    "The nuclei dynamics can effectively be considered as a constant shift in the energy of the electronic system. \n",
    "For a system of M nuclei and N electrons, the Hamiltonian can be decomposed into the following terms  \n",
    "\n",
    "\\begin{equation}\n",
    "    \\mathcal{H} = \\sum_{i=1}^N(-\\frac{1}{2}\\nabla^2_i - \\sum_{j=1}^M\\frac{Z_j}{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{R}_j|}) + \\frac{1}{2}\\sum_{i,j=1}^N\\frac{1}{|\\mathbf{r}_i - \\mathbf{r}_j|}, \\label{eq:hamil}\n",

    "\n",
    "where $\\nabla_i$ corresponds to the gradient with respect to $\\mathbf{r}_i$ and $Z_j$ is the atomic number of the $j$-th nucleus. \n",
    "The first term is a sum over the single-electron Hamiltonian consisting of the kinetic $T$ and potential $V$ parts and the second term represents a sum over the electron-electron Coulomb interaction denoted by $U$, i.e., $\\mathcal{H}=T+V+U$. \n",
    "We note that there is an implicit sum over spin degrees of freedom as well. \n",
    "Solving the above Schrodinger's equation exactly is in general intractable due to the electron-electron interactions especially in a crystalline system where the number of electrons is of the order of $10^{23}$. \n",
    "Here is where the density functional theory comes into the picture by providing approximate solutions. "

    "The density functional theory provides a systematic way to simplify the many-body Hamiltonian and map it into an effective single-particle Hamiltonian. \n",

    "In other words, the ground-state wavefunction of the system is a *functional* of the electron density, that is $\\psi_0=\\psi[n_0]$. \n",

    "The general approach to solve for the ground state of the system is to start from an initial density and then calculate the corresponding energies and the wavefunctions of the system.\n",

    "- **Non-physical energies and orbitals**:\n",
    "    The eigenvalues $\\epsilon_i$ and eigenfunctions $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$ of the Kohn-Sham equations are in general not physical. \n",
    "    The reason is that $\\phi_i(\\mathbf{r})$ orbitals are single-electron orbitals are obtained from a higher dimensional many-electron wavefucntion and therefore are not unique. \n",
    "    The energies similarly do not simply add up to the true energy of the system $E$ in the original Hamiltonian. \n",
    "    The difference comes from the electron correlations which are treated in a mean-field approach in the Kohn-Sham potential. \n",
    "- **Excited states**: \n",
    "    As a result of the non-physical nature of the eigenvalues $\\epsilon_i$, properties that directly depend on the Kohn-Shan eigenvalues, such as the band gap and the ionization energy, cannot be calculated accurately.\n",
    "    Since the correlation energies are usually underestimated in the Kohn-Sham potentials, the resulting band gap is also underestimated. \n",
    "    However, in the past few decades the DFT calculations on materials with weak correlation effects (such as semiconductors) have shown that the Kohn-Sham energies provide an acceptable approximation to the true many-electron energies obtained from experiments [8].  \n",
    "\n",
    "In electron systems where electron correlations are significant, such as transition metal oxides (superconductors or Mott insulators), it should be noted that the Kohn-Sham equations are not capable of predicting the correct many-electron properties of the system. \n",
    "The above limitations, to some extent, can be resolved by utilizing additional corrections to the correlation effects such as the $DFT+U$ method [5] and the GW approximation [7]. \n",
    "However, since the materials we study in this work (from the $p$ block of the periodic table) are not shown to be highly correlated electron systems, we can consider the solutions of the Kohn-Sham equations to be a good approximation to the true energies of the system while keeping in mind that the band gap we obtain is most probably underestimated.
